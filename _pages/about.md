I am a Master of Science student in Robotics Systems Development at Carnegie Mellon University, with a strong background in reinforcement learning, robotics, and control systems. Previously, I worked as a Senior Associate Engineer at Caterpillar Inc, where I developed reinforcement learning-based microgrid controllers and led the development of Hardware-in-the-Loop test benches.

My research interests include:
- **Robotics**: Manipulation, computer vision, and motion planning
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Applications in robotics and control systems
- **Control Systems**: Microgrid energy management and optimization

I have experience working with ROS2, PyTorch, OpenCV, and various robotics simulation tools. My current projects include developing dual-arm robotic systems for medical inventory labeling and implementing imitation learning pipelines for robotic manipulation tasks.

I hold a Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering from the National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal, and have two patents in microgrid control systems.
